.SH NAME
.PP
crontab \- manipulate per\-user crontabs (dillon's lightweight cron
daemon)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]crontab file [\-u user]\f[] \- replace crontab from file
.PP
\f[B]crontab \- [\-u user]\f[] \- replace crontab from stdin
.PP
\f[B]crontab \-l [\-u user]\f[] \- list crontab for user
.PP
\f[B]crontab \-e [\-u user]\f[] \- edit crontab for user
.PP
\f[B]crontab \-d [\-u user]\f[] \- delete crontab for user
.PP
\f[B]crontab \-c dir\f[] \- specify crontab directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]crontab\f[] command manipulates the per\-user crontabs.
If you are looking for the format of these files, see \[lq]man 5
crontab\[rq].
.PP
Generally the \-e option is used to edit your crontab.
\f[B]crontab\f[] will use the editor specified by your EDITOR or VISUAL
environment variable (or /usr/bin/vi) to edit the crontab:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ crontab\ \-e
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Just as a regular user, the superuser also has his or her own per\-user
crontab.
.SH NOTES
.PP
\f[B]crontab\f[] doesn't provide the kinds of protections that programs
like \f[B]visudo\f[] do against syntax errors and simultaneous edits.
Errors won't be detected until \f[B]crond\f[] reads the crontab file.
What \f[B]crontab\f[] does is provide a mechanism for users who may not
themselves have write privileges to the crontab folder to nonetheless
install or edit their crontabs.
It also notifies a running crond daemon of any changes to these files.
.PP
Only users who belong to the same group as the \f[B]crontab\f[] binary
will be able to install or edit crontabs.
However it'll be possible for the superuser to install crontabs even for
users who don't have the privileges to install them themselves.
(Even for users who don't have a login shell.) Only the superuser may
use the \-u or \-c switches to specify a different user and/or crontab
directory.
